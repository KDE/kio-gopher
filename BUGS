Konqueror makes too much use of the extensions, and i don't know how to sort 
that.
 - gopher://gopher.quux.org/Humor and Fun/Microsoft_KSH.txt is a directory so 
   it should be shown as html, but konqueror shows it as a text file.
 - gopher://gopher.quux.org/Archives/mirrors/ftp.cs.indiana.edu is a directory
   so it should be shown as html but konqueror thinks it is a keduca file and
   wants to save it :-/

i suppose more similar things
