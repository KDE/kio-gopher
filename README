Gopher kioslave Readme

This adds support for the gopher protocol to konqueror.

It is still in development.

It has been tested to work with KDE 3.2 Betas.
KDE 3.1.x is not supported, but it is likely to work.

Currently it supports most (if not all) of the gopher protocol. 

Support for gopher+ protocol is planned.
