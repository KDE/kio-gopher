Gopher kioslave Readme

This is a small readme for anyone curious enough to checkout that 
gopher kioslave and try it.

It is still in development. 
Currently supports partially gopher protocol (only types 0 and 1 are 
recognised). Support for gopher+ protocol is planned.

Known bugs:
gopher://gopher.quux.org/Humor and Fun/Microsoft_KSH.txt renders as 
text/plain and it should be text/html
