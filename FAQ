Q: kio_gopher built and installed succesfully but i type gopher://foo.com in
   konqueror and it doesn't works. What can i do?
A: This is because kio_gopher was installed to a bad path, this is possibly
   due to KDEDIR environment variable not defined, either define it or
   use ./configure --prefix=<your_kde_dir>

Q: What should i put in KDEDIR or --prefix=<your_kde_dir>?
A: That depends on your very own distribution, for Mandrake it is /usr
   but other distributions use other paths, as a guess you can try 
   something like
      which konqueror
      /usr/local/kdecvs/bin/konqueror
   in that case /usr/local/kdecvs would be the correct path
